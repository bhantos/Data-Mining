# Data mining and machine learning
Course taught by Bálint Ármin Pataki @ ELTE.

This repo contains my work for the course.

The topics of the course
* 01 Exploratory data analysis
* 02 Unsupervised learning & clustering: TSNE, PCA, hierarchical clustering
* 03 k Nearest Neighbors
* 04 Linear regression 
* 05 Logistic regression 
* 06 Regularization, model selection 
* 07 Support vector machines
* 08 Tree models 
* 09 Fully connected neural networks
* 10 Convolutional neural networks (Keras)
* 11 More neural networks 
* 12 Word embedding, RNNs 

My main project was exploring and analysing a dataset of used cars and predicting prices with gradient boosting.
